Community Collaboration Pixel Art Project - Steem to the Moon!

Website is : https://steemmoon.com/

This project is designed to be a collaboration for any Steemians who want to add to a communal art piece.  I love pixel art because you don't need to know how to draw, you don't really need any skills... except patience.  The communal art piece is designed to be filled in from the middle and worked outwards.

This app is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and also uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction).

There's still a long way to go coding-wise, so please feel free to contribute.

All pixel art contributions will need to have a Steem Blockchain post with some progress images to verify that the artwork is indeed an original piece made for SteemMoon.  Once accepted, they'll be added onto the website.
